# RSA Notes

Notes were extracted from [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))

e = 2 to power 16 | 65537 | can be smaller but leaves encryption weaker
e = public key exponent and needed for encryption
d = private key exponent and needed for decryption

n = (p*q)

n is used as the modulus for both public and private keys
